@node IPv6 Support
@chapter IPv6 Support

Quagga fully supports IPv6 routing.  As described so far, Quagga supports
RIPng, OSPFv3, Babel and BGP-4+.  You can give IPv6 addresses to an interface
and configure static IPv6 routing information.  Quagga IPv6 also provides
automatic address configuration via a feature called @code{address
auto configuration}.  To do it, the router must send router advertisement
messages to the all nodes that exist on the network.

@node Router Advertisement
@section Router-scope RA commands

@deffn Command {ipv6 nd suppress-ra} {}
Configure the router-scope setting NOT to send router advertisement messages
(each interface configuration may override this). This setting is the default.
@end deffn

@deffn Command {no ipv6 nd suppress-ra} {}
Configure the router-scope setting to send router advertisement messages (each
interface configuration may override this).
@end deffn

@deffn Command {ipv6 nd rdnss @var{ipv6address}} {}
@deffnx Command {no ipv6 nd rdnss @var{ipv6address}} {}
@deffnx Command {ipv6 nd dnssl @var{domain}} {}
@deffnx Command {no ipv6 nd dnssl @var{domain}} {}
Manage router-scope lists of RDNSS/DNSSL entries. These entries will be
prepended to each interface's own lists of RDNSS/DNSSL entries. Custom lifetime
is not supported in these commands, the entries configured this way will always
have lifetime 2 times the current @var{ra-interval} of each interface.
@end deffn

@deffn Command {ipv6 nd prefix connected-none} {}
Configure the router-scope setting NOT to generate Prefix Information TLVs for
connected prefixes (each interface configuration may override this). This
setting is the default.
@end deffn

@deffn Command {ipv6 nd prefix connected-all [@var{valid-lifetime}] [@var{preferred-lifetime}] [off-link] [no-autoconfig]} {}
Configure the router-scope setting to generate Prefix Information TLVs for all
connected prefixes except link-local ones (each interface configuration may
override this).
@end deffn

@section Interface-scope RA commands
@deffn {Interface Command} {ipv6 nd suppress-ra auto} {}

command is not visible in interface configuration section of running-config
text. This setting is default for all new interfaces.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interface Command} {no ipv6 nd suppress-ra} {}
Configure the interface to send router advertisment messages regardless of
router-scope @code{suppress-ra} setting. This command is visible in interface
configuration section of running-config text.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interface Command} {ipv6 nd suppress-ra} {}
Configure the interface NOT to send router advertisment messages regardless of
router-scope @code{suppress-ra} setting. This command is visible in interface
configuration section of running-config text.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interface Command} {ipv6 nd prefix @var{ipv6prefix} [@var{valid-lifetime}] [@var{preferred-lifetime}] [off-link] [no-autoconfig] [router-address]} {}
Configuring the IPv6 prefix to include in router advertisements. Several prefix
specific optional parameters and flags may follow:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@var{valid-lifetime} - the length of time in seconds during what the prefix is
valid for the purpose of on-link determination. Value @var{infinite} represents
infinity (i.e. a value of all one bits (@code{0xffffffff})).

Range: @code{<0-4294967295>}  Default: @code{2592000}

@item
@var{preferred-lifetime} - the length of time in seconds during what addresses
generated from the prefix remain preferred. Value @var{infinite} represents
infinity.

Range: @code{<0-4294967295>}  Default: @code{604800}

@item
@var{off-link} - indicates that advertisement makes no statement about on-link or
off-link properties of the prefix.

Default: not set, i.e. this prefix can be used for on-link determination.

@item
@var{no-autoconfig} - indicates to hosts on the local link that the specified prefix
cannot be used for IPv6 autoconfiguration.

Default: not set, i.e. prefix can be used for autoconfiguration.

@item
@var{router-address} - indicates to hosts on the local link that the specified 
prefix 
contains a complete IP address by setting R flag.

Default: not set, i.e. hosts do not assume a complete IP address is placed.

@deffn {Interface Command} {ipv6 nd prefix connected-auto} {}
@deffnx {Interface Command} {no ipv6 nd prefix (connected-all|connected-none)} {}

@deffnx {Interface Command} {no ipv6 nd home-agent-preference [<0-65535>]} {}

@end deffn

@deffn {Interface Command} {ipv6 nd mtu <1-65535>} {}
@deffnx {Interface Command} {no ipv6 nd mtu [<1-65535>]} {}

in proper interface configuration. The announced value is not verified to be
consistent with router interface MTU.

Default: don't advertise any MTU option
@end deffn

@deffn {Interface Command} {ipv6 nd rdnss @var{ipv6address} [@var{lifetime}]} {}
@deffnx {Interface Command} {no ipv6 nd rdnss @var{ipv6address} [@var{lifetime}]} {}
Include RDNSS options to advertise recursive DNS server addresses. Additionally
a maximum lifetime (in seconds) can be specified to limit the lifetime of each
server. The default lifetime - without explicitly specified lifetime - is 2
times current @var{ra-interval}. A valid range for a manually configured
@var{lifetime} is between @code{<1-4294967294>}, given that it is no less than
1 time current @var{ra-interval} and no greater than 2 times current
@var{ra-interval}. Special keyword @code{obsolete} stands for value @code{0}
and means, that the RDNSS address must no longer be used. Special keyword
@code{infinite} stands for value @code{0xFFFFFFFF} and means, that the server
is infinitely valid.

Note, that server addresses in the RA packet follow the order visible in the
"running-config" text. If you need the servers to go in a different order in
the packet, make "running-config" list them as required. In a CLI session this
takes necessary amount of "no ipv6 nd rdnss ..." and "ipv6 nd rdnss..." commands.

See below for router-scope variant of this command.
@end deffn

@deffn {Interface Command} {ipv6 nd dnssl @var{domain} [@var{lifetime}]} {}
@deffnx {Interface Command} {no ipv6 nd dnssl @var{domain} [@var{lifetime}]} {}

Include DNSSL options to advertise DNS search list domains. Note, that ordering
of DNSSL records is subject for the same rules, as for the RDNSS records
described above.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@var{domain} - a DNS search domain (e.g. domain.example.com) without the
trailing "root" period. The domain name must meet the requirements of RFC1035.

@item
@var{lifetime} - lifetime in seconds with the same semantics as in
"ipv6 nd rdnss ..." command.

Range: @code{(obsolete|<1-4294967294>|infinite)}

Default: 2 times current @var{ra-interval}
